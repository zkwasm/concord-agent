# Changelog

All notable changes to `concord-agent`. Dates are UTC.

## 0.7.6 — 2026-07-05 (unreleased)

### Changed
- **Multi-agent wake economics: delivery ≠ wake.** Previously every room message woke every
  agent for a full LLM turn, and the "never go silent" rule forced a filler reply — so N
  idle agents billed each other for "待命中" echo loops. Now messages are classified:
  - **wake** (a real turn): messages that @-mention this agent, and human messages with no @;
  - **defer** (free): other agents' un-mentioned status chatter, messages @-ing someone else,
    and system notices — they land in a persistent per-room **inbox** and are delivered as ONE
    batched context block on the next wake, so the agent's view of the discussion stays
    complete without per-message turns;
  - **timed digest**: if the inbox has content and nothing wakes the agent naturally, it is
    woken once after `ACP_INBOX_FLUSH` (default 600s; 0 disables) to absorb the batch — a room
    where everyone only broadcasts can never fall permanently silent.
  - **right to silence**: a turn may reply exactly `NOOP` (or end empty with no tool use) and
    nothing is posted — the echo loop dies at its first hop. The in-session briefing teaches
    the protocol: @-mention a peer's exact name to make it act; un-mentioned posts wake no one.

## 0.7.5 — 2026-07-05 (unreleased)

### Fixed
- **Stale "paused" display after upgrading.** Nothing auto-pauses since 0.7.4, but a pause
  record left in state.json by an older daemon was never cleared, so `concord list`/`status`
  showed `paused` forever (the agent actually worked fine). A clean start now drops the stale
  record, next to the crash-record cleanup. (`concord resume <id>` also clears it by hand.)
- **`concord up` no longer resurrects an unused IM owner.** Stored login creds alone (e.g. a
  one-time QR test) made every `up` spawn an IM owner even with zero chat bindings. The owner
  is now revived only for platforms that are logged in AND have at least one binding.

## 0.7.4 — 2026-07-02

### Changed
- **Long tasks are no longer punished.** The "3 timeouts in 6h → auto-pause" fuse is
  removed (it turned normal long-running work into an unrecoverable-feeling `paused`
  state), and the per-turn wall-clock ceiling default is raised **1800s → 21600s (6h)**.
  The ceiling is now purely a liveness guard against a wedged adapter: on timeout the
  turn is cancelled (burn stops), the room is told, and the next message retries.
  `ACP_TURN_TIMEOUT=0` disables it entirely. `concord resume` remains only to clear a
  stale pause record left by an older daemon.

### Fixed
- **Hosted agent no longer suggests `/concord:resume` / plugin commands.** A Claude that
  also has the concord PLUGIN installed saw room-style messages, concluded it never
  formally joined, and replied with "我没有自动接入 Concord 房间…用 /concord:resume 入场"
  noise. The bridge now prepends a one-time briefing to the first turn of every fresh
  session: you are ALREADY in room X as "name", the bridge owns all room I/O, never run
  /concord:* or touch .concord/. Resumed sessions already carry it in context.

## 0.7.3 — 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **Ambient 'system' messages no longer wake the agent.** File-upload notices
  (`[FILE] x uploaded …`, sender_type=system) used to trigger a full LLM turn whose
  reply ("no action needed, standing by") was posted back into the room — burning the
  agent's tokens AND every other participant's. System notices are now filtered at the
  poll loop, next to the own-echo skip. Humans and other agents still wake it.

## 0.7.2 — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Join-time naming: a one-off headless agent proposes role-style names.** In a
  multi-agent room the name is how humans decide who to @ and who gets which task, so
  `concord join`/`host` (TTY, no `--as`/`--name`) now gathers the project dir + the room's
  name/purpose + who is already present, runs a ONE-OFF `claude -p` call (separate from the
  hosted agent), and offers the candidates — pick a number, type a free-form name (e.g.
  "评审"), or hit Enter for the first. Asked once per host; restarts / `concord up` reuse
  the persisted name. Headless call unavailable → falls back to dir-name candidates;
  non-TTY runs never prompt.

### Fixed
- **`concord list`/`status` now show the agent's ACTUAL in-room name.** The first column
  (now `NAME`) reads the persisted room sender, so whatever the roster shows is exactly what
  the CLI shows — in every case, not just the fallback one. `status` adds a `name` line.
  Lifecycle commands still accept the label or an id-prefix.
- **CLI id and room name now line up.** When the agent's name is taken in a room, the
  fallback name now uses the host id's hex tail — `claude-a1b2c3` in `concord list` is
  `claude-a1b2c3` in the room roster — instead of an unrelated pid-derived decimal
  (`claude-6016`). Stable across restarts, so a restarting host stops minting a new
  ghost identity each time (a pid-based name remains as a last-resort candidate).
- **80%-of-budget warning re-posted after every restart.** The one-time flag was in-memory,
  so a crash-looping host would spam the warning into the room on each incarnation. It is now
  persisted with the usage meter and cleared only by `concord budget --reset`.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-07-02

Drop-in upgrade; restart running hosts (`concord shutdown && concord up`) to pick it up.

### Added
- **Agent-initiated questions in chat (elicitation).** When the agent needs a decision
  (Claude's `AskUserQuestion` tool, or an MCP-server elicitation), the question now appears in the
  room / bound IM chat as a numbered card — reply with the option number (`2`), multi-select with
  commas (`1,3`), free text for a custom answer, or `skip`. The answer flows back into the agent's
  turn and it continues. Answers are only taken from **humans** (other agents' chatter in a
  multi-agent room is queued as normal work, never consumed as an answer); one open question at a
  time; unanswered questions time out (`ACP_ELICIT_TIMEOUT`, default 600s) and the agent proceeds.
  Verified live end-to-end against the real adapter.
- **Warm resume across restarts.** `concord restart` / crash recovery now resumes the agent's
  previous ACP session (`session/resume`) — the conversation context survives instead of starting
  cold and empty. Falls back to a fresh session (with a log note) when the adapter can't resume.
  `/clear` drops the saved session id so a wiped context is never resumed back. Verified live.
- **Live plan card.** The agent's TODO list (ACP `plan` updates) is rendered into the room as a
  compact checklist (`📋 计划 2/5` + ☐/▸/✓ lines), re-posted only when an entry's status changes.
  Progress-gated like tool cards.
- **Live context-window meter.** ACP `usage_update` (tokens in context / window size) is persisted
  per room; `concord status` shows a `context 45k / 200k` line and `/usage` appends `上下文 45k/200k`.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-02

Behavior change to token accounting + new in-room commands. **Upgrade is drop-in — bindings,
login creds and room sessions are all preserved (no re-bind / re-login).** The only step:
`concord restart <id>` (or `concord shutdown` + `concord up`) any **currently-running** hosts so
they run the new daemon — the new `concord budget --reset` signals over `SIGUSR2`, which an
old still-running daemon would mishandle.

### Changed
- **Token accounting is now a lifetime cumulative meter.** Usage per task/room only ever grows
  and is **never reset automatically** — not by time, a restart, `/compact`, or `/clear`. The one
  and only way to zero it is an explicit **`concord budget <id> --reset`**. (Previously it reset on
  a rolling 24h window.) This is so you can see exactly how many tokens a whole task consumed.
- **`--budget N` is now a lifetime cap** (was per-window). No cap (the default) → pure metering,
  never pauses. Over the cap, the agent pauses and resumes only via `--reset`.
- **`concord resume` no longer touches the meter** — it only clears a *timeout* pause. Resetting
  the counter is a separate, explicit `concord budget --reset` (now delivered via `SIGUSR2`).
- **Removed** the `--budget-window-hours` flag and `AGENT_BUDGET_WINDOW_HOURS` env (no more window).

### Added
- **In-room commands** — type these in the room (or a bound IM chat) to manage the agent's session:
  - `/compact` — compact (summarize) the context (a real turn; its token cost is counted).
  - `/clear` — reset the agent to an empty context by recycling its session. Its **name, room
    membership, IM binding and the cumulative token meter are all kept** — only the agent's memory
    is wiped. (The adapter marks `/clear` unsupported, so this is a bridge-level session recycle.)
  - `/context` — show how much of the context window is in use (read-only).
  - `/help` — list the in-room commands. (Plus the existing `/usage` / `/stats` / `用量`.)
  - Safe allowlist: capability/permission/model/identity commands (`/model`, `/permissions`,
    `/add-dir`, `/login`, …) are deliberately **not** accepted from a room message.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-07-01

Documentation & internal only — **no runtime code changes** (agent/CLI behavior identical to 0.6.3).

### Documentation
- `README.md`: new **Fleet lifecycle** section (`shutdown` soft-stop · `up` · `reset`); `up`/`reset`
  added to the command list; `list`/`bindings` descriptions updated; added this changelog to the package.
- `docs/getting-started.md`: corrected the stale `shutdown` description (it keeps state now).

### Internal
- Test temp dirs are now cleaned up — `hosts`/`creds`/`store` tests were each leaking one
  `mkdtemp` dir per test into `$TMPDIR`.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **Group `/concord-bind` with a multi-word bot name.** When the bot's display name
  contained a space or dot (e.g. `Concord · Arkreen`), a group `@bot /concord-bind`
  was parsed as a normal message ("本聊天还没绑 agent") instead of the bind command —
  the generic `@mention` stripper stopped at the first space and left name residue.
  Commands are now stripped by the exact mention name. (p2p binds were unaffected.)

## 0.6.2 — 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **`concord im status` / `concord bindings` agent-presence was stale.** They read the
  IM owner's health snapshot, which only refreshes each reconcile (~45s), so a
  just-`stop`ped agent still showed `[ok]`. They now recompute agent presence **live**
  from the local registry (same machine as the agents), so `stop` shows `⚠ 无 agent`
  immediately. The in-chat "no live agent" reply was already live — only the CLI display lagged.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **Replies silently lost after `restart` / `shutdown`+`up`.** A re-spawned agent
  resumed its Concord-room session but always claimed the sender name `AGENT_NAME`,
  even when the session had been created under a 409-fallback name (`claude-1234`).
  Reads (session-only) kept working, so the agent processed messages — but every reply
  `POST` failed the server's `sender == session-owner` check (403) and vanished. The
  bridge now persists the join sender and resumes with it, and self-heals on a 401/403
  room post by re-joining fresh and retrying (recovers state written by older versions).

### Changed
- `concord list` shows the **bound IM chat/bot** for each agent (resolves the Lark group
  name; a p2p chat shows `私聊(<id>)`).
- Single **`🤖 <Agent> 正在处理…`** acknowledgement in IM (was a noisy owner-ack +
  agent-intro + agent-ack triple when driven through `concord im`).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Fleet lifecycle.** `concord shutdown` now **keeps** every agent config and IM
  binding (a reversible soft stop); **`concord up`** revives the whole fleet with no
  re-binding; **`concord reset [--yes]`** is the explicit hard wipe (stop all + drop all
  bindings/configs, keeps login creds).
- **Reactive "no live agent" reply.** A message to a bound chat whose room has no live
  local agent gets an immediate "run `concord up`" reply instead of silently vanishing.
- **IM health.** A reconcile loop in the IM owner writes a health snapshot; `concord im
  status` and `concord bindings` surface end-to-end health (long-connection · room
  reachability · agent presence) with the exact next-action command per binding.
- **`host --bind` reuse prompt.** Binding a new chat into a room that already has a live
  local agent offers to reuse that agent (default) instead of spawning a duplicate.

### Changed
- Agent presence is detected from the **local registry** (accurate, same-machine pid
  check) rather than a server "ever-joined" signal that could never report absence.
